# Finzy

A modern Jellyfin client for desktop and mobile. Built with Flutter for native performance and a clean interface.

Finzy is a fork of [Plezy](https://github.com/edde746/plezy), a modern cross-platform Plex client built with Flutter, adapted for [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) instead of Plex.

**Support development** — If you enjoy Finzy, you can leave a tip via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/dkmcgowan). Optional and much appreciated.

## Looking for Android testers

I’m trying to get Finzy through Google Play’s closed testing requirement.

If you already use Jellyfin and want to help:

1. Join the Google Group:
   https://groups.google.com/g/finzyclosedtesting

2. Join the Play Store test:
   https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.dkmcgowan.finzy

3. Install Finzy from Google Play:
   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dkmcgowan.finzy

Please use the Google Play version during testing instead of a sideloaded APK so updates come through the Play Store automatically while I work toward the official release.
